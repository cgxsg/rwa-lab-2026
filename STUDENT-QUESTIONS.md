# STUDENT-QUESTIONS.md — Discussion questions (goes inside your submission zip)

Answer directly under each question. 150–300 words each — **reasoning over length**.

The sections follow the four planks of the bridge. There are no standard answers; these are the
real point of the lab.

## A. Custody — where the asset actually is (plank a)

**A1.** In Lab 1, `totalCollateral()` read the vault's own ERC-20 balance, and the chain could
prove the invariant. Here, `MockTBillCustodian.realHoldings()` is just a number that a permissioned
address can move. Write the equivalent of `totalCollateral() == totalSupply()` for *this* system.
What does it actually assert, and what does it no longer prove?

**A2.** The T-Bills are held by an SPV, a legal entity set up so the fund's assets are bankruptcy-
remote from the issuer. Explain in your own words why a *legal* structure is part of a *technical*
design. If the SPV's custodian goes bankrupt, what does the on-chain token entitle its holder to?

## B. Attestation — how the chain learns the truth (plank b)

**B1.** `attest()` is the only function that moves the NAV, and it is gated by `REPORTER_ROLE`.
Everything downstream — subscription pricing, redemption payouts, both invariants — believes that
number. Name the failure modes of a single trusted reporter, and one mechanism (technical,
financial, or legal) that mitigates each.

> Your answer:

<br><br><br>

**B2.** A production feed would check whether `updatedAt` is stale; this lab's mock does not. A
**frozen** NAV is a different attack from a **wrong** NAV. Describe how a stale-but-honest NAV can
be exploited by someone who knows the true value has moved.

## C. Redemption — T+1 does not settle on-chain (plank c)

**C1.** The queue locks the payout at the NAV of **enqueue** time, not **settle** time. If the NAV
rises between the two, who gains and who loses — the redeemer, or the holders who stayed? Is that
the right allocation of risk, and how would you change it?

> Your answer:

<br><br><br>

**C2.** In a 2008 money-market fund breaking the buck, and in USDC's 2023 depeg, redemptions were
handled very differently. Compare the two. For a tokenized T-Bill fund, what does it mean to "close
the redemption channel", and what should happen to the queue when it does?

> Your answer:

<br><br><br>

## D. Admission — the guest list and the backdoor (plank d)

**D1.** Every balance change in `TBillToken._update` checks **both** endpoints against the
whitelist. That is what stops a sanctioned address from receiving shares — and also what stops a
completely ordinary user who has not finished KYC. Where is the right line for a regulated fund,
and who should be able to move it?

> Your answer:

<br><br><br>

**D2.** The compliance power that freezes an account is the same power that can force-transfer
tokens out of it. That is required for a regulated product and is also a censorship tool. Argue
**both** sides, then say what safeguards you would add and who would hold the key.

## E. Tests (Tier 1 required — this is Ex4)

Turn the red tests green in `test/exercises/01_AttestationTasks.t.sol` to cover the scenarios
below, and write your test function names here:

| Scenario | Your test function name |
|---|---|
| A non-whitelisted address cannot receive shares, even by paying | |
| A whitelisted holder cannot send shares to a non-whitelisted address | |
| Removing an address from the list freezes that holder | |
| A `MINTER_ROLE` holder can burn anyone's balance — the backdoor exists | |
| `pause()` freezes transfers, minting and redemption together | |

Then write one more scenario you consider **most likely to be exploited** on a tokenized fund, and
say which plank it breaks:
